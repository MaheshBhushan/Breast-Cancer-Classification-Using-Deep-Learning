# Breast Cancer Classification using Deep Learning
## Description
This project focuses on the classification of breast cancer using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to analyze medical images of breast tissue and accurately classify them as either benign or malignant, aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab(Recommended)
- numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit Learn
- Matplotlib
